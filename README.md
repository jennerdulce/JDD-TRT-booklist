## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Book App is a web based application that uses Google Books API to create a quick way for users to search for books based on title or author.  Results generate images, descriptions, titles and authors of all books that fall within the search scope.  

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
First, create a basic back-end server by defining dependencies, establishing PORT, and setting up routes.  Because we are using EJS it is necessary to include use .set to incorporate an EJS view engine.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
EXPRESS - Express is a flexible Node.js used for as a web framework application. Express offers a thin layer of fundamental web application without obscuring Node.js features.

EJS (Embedded JavaScript) - Use of EJS to render results and display on the webpage. This allows the backend to essentially do all the work
without the need of a front end

NODE - Asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime environment. Used to design and build scalable network apps.

NPM (Node Package Manager) - Package manger for NODE. Allows users to bring in libraries which are used to help developers build applications

HEROKU - A platform as a service that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud

GITHUB - Cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code as well as keep tabs on changes to their code.

SUPERAGENT - Allows us to request data by using a URL from APIs and obtains a PROMISE as a response.
